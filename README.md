# Employee-Management-System
Overview
An employee management system consisting of crucial work-related and important personal information about employees. Human Resources (HR) can manage their employees efficiently using this web application.

Purpose
I created an online employee management system web application that will allow users can add, edit, update, search and delete employees. It will also allow Admin update code and assigned sections using an Admin dashboard (Admin page will be implemented in the future).

Functionalities:
1. Add employee information:
    * Id
    * First-Name
    * Last-Name
    * Email-Id

2. Edit and Delete:
Be able to edit and delete employees from the database. An employee's details are automatically populated when the admin clicks the edit button.

3. Display employees:
Be able to retrieve employees from a REST API and display them.

5. REST API:
Built REST API using Springboot and Angular to implement above functionalities.

Used technologies:
    * Angular
    * SpringBoot
    * Java
    * Oracle
    * REST API
    * Spring-MVC
    * Hibernate
